# Uno Calculator

The Uno Calculator is a port of the [Windows Calculator](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator) to C# and the [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno) for iOS, Android and WebAssembly.

The app provides standard, scientific, and programmer calculator functionality, as well as a set of converters between various units of measurement and currencies.

The Uno Calculator will regularly follow with the Windows Calculator updates. You can get it from the [App Store](https://bit.ly/calc-ios), [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uno.platform.calculator), [in your browser](https://calculator.platform.uno), and of course the original calculator on the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHVN5).
